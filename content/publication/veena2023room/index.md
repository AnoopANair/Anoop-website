abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroic materials are those which can be influenced by both electric and magnetic fields and have wide applications. Single-phase materials that show magnetoelectric effects are very few compared to composites. Recently, several studies have been conducted on magnetic and dielectric properties of single-phase double perovskite Sr2FeNbO6, while magnetoelectric effects have not been reported yet. The present study aims to explore the magnetoelectric effects of Sr2FeNbO6 prepared through solid-state reaction route. Rietveld refinement confirms the orthorhombic symmetry of the material with Pbnm space group. The existence of Fe2+, Fe3+, and Nb5+ ions were investigated by XPS analysis. The room temperature magnetic and electric hysteresis loops display the simultaneous existence of magnetism and ferroelectricity in Sr2FeNbO6. A high Curie temperature of 727 K is obtained from temperature-dependent variation of magnetization, making it suitable for spintronics applications. Further, this room temperature multiferroicity of Sr2FeNbO6 was confirmed using magnetoelectric coupling measurement and obtained a coupling coefficient of 4.4 mV cm−1 Oe−1. The conclusion of Sr2FeNbO6 showing ferrimagnetic nature is obtained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
