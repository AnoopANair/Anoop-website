abstract: The design of cube-connected nanorods is accomplished by connecting seed nanocrystals of a defined shape in a particular orientation or by etching selective facets of preformed nanorods. In lead halide perovskite nanostructures, which retain mostly a hexahedron cube shape, such patterned nanorods can be designed with the anisotropic direction along the edge, vertex, or facet of seed cubes. Combining the Cs-sublattice platform for transforming metal halides to halide perovskites with facet-specific ligand binding chemistry, herein, vertex-oriented patterning of nanocubes in one-dimensional (1D) rod structures is reported. By tuning the length of host metal halides, their lengths could also be tuned from 100 nm to nearly 1000 nm. The symmetry of the hexagonal phase of host halide CsCdBr3 and product orthorhombic CsPbBr3 helped in maintaining the vertex 201 as the anisotropic direction. Neutral exciton recombination rates, extracted from photoluminescence blinking traces, showed a systematic increase from isolated cubes to cube-connected nanorods of various lengths. Efficient coupling of wave functions in vertex-oriented cube assemblies permits exciton delocalization. Our findings on carrier delocalization in cube-connected nanorods along their vertex direction having minimum interfacial contacts provide valuable insights into the fundamental chemistry of assembling anisotropic halide perovskite nanostructures as conducting wires.
